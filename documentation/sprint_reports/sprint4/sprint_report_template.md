# Sprint x Report (01/05/23 - 02/02/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Delivered module 1 executable to stakeholder
 * Bug-fixed a previous version of application (module-0)
 * Delivered module 0 exectuable to stakeholder
 * Updated .csv export function


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we spent a bit of time getting back up to speed with our stakeholder and setting expectations for this semester. The main focus of this sprint was compiling our code into an executable that could be delivered to our stakeholder and utilized in a live environment. We successfully tested the application on the destination computer and expect the program to have success during live experimentation.

We have a large amount of issues to still be completed that will be moved into the following sprint. I'm not including these in the sprint review because, while included on the project board, these were not commitments we made with our client nor with our team and are meant to be represented as backlog items.
