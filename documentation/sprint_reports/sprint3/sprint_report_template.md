# Sprint x Report (11/05/23 - 12/05/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Added CO2 Sample and Zero UI Elements
 * Added calculated %Co2/Volt, %Co2, and uBar Co2 displays
 * Added real-time uBar Plot
 * Added real-time D(uBar) Plot
 * Improved graph scaling
 * Clean and removed unused UI elements


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we added a great amount of functionality. Key calculation work was completed, which was fed into two new real-time graphs that display relevant information. A lot of work had to go into user interface work and support for various features of these new plots. Additionally, many bugs were discovered in the process of these feature implementations, as a result various code refactors were completed.

## Unfinished Work
* O2 Calibrations
