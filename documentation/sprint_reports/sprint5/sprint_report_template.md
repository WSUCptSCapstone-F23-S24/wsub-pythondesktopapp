# Sprint x Report (02/05/23 - 03/02/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Improved module 2: added new user interface features, added o2 calculations, temperature input and calibration.


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we started work towards each of the new modules. We've shifted to a three prong approach as opposed to the entire team working on the same project at the same time. As it stands, Tomer completed improvements to module 2, Jack started work on module 3, and I worked alongside our stakeholder to develop a system for pulling data from a new device. We had varying success on each of these projects, with most of success laying with Tomer's work on module 2.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Communication with stakeholders
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
  * Completing work earlier in the sprint

We had some commitments this sprint that we fell short on. Unfortunately during the sprint we had multiple team members lose out on productivity due to sickness and multiple WSU-related travel events. This combination really dropped the overall productivity of the team and I suspect we will be able to make better contributions next sprint.
