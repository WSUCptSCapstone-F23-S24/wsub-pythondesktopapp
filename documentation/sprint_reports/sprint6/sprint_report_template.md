# Sprint x Report (03/05/23 - 04/02/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Progress towards integration of new data source
 * Module 3 completed
 * Module 2 further refined


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint was largely a continuation of the sprint 5, we are still working in a three pronge approach where each team member is working on their own piece within the project. Each of these pronges has completed some meaningful progress, beyond the starting points that we had last sprint. Notably, Module 3 is functionally complete but may need some refinement. Module 2 has been further refined. And construction towards the full integration of a new data source has been continued. 

NOTE: please look at individual branches to see progresses made this sprint. Progress has not been merged to master, as each seperate project operates on the same files, so we will have to do some directory refactoring in order to integrate all modules in one repo.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
 * Tackling difficult problems
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
  * Completing work earlier in the sprint
  * Communication with stakeholders, I think our team would benefit from more structured and intentional communication with our stakeholders.
