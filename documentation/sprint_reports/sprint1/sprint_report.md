# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/23 - 10/05/2023)

## What's New 
* Completed Project Specification Document
* Met with Dr. Cousins, our primary stakeholder
* Gathered understanding of existing project
* Downloaded and ran provided codebase
 

## Work Summary 
This first sprint was a challenge for the team. We unfortunately had a slow start due to scheduling issues the first few weeks which meant we couldn't have our first meeting with our stakeholder until the third week of this sprint. This delay put the team on the defense for the rest of sprint, doing our best to catch up with documentation requirements and understand the existing product and requirements for incoming sprints. We were able to succesfully digest the project given to us by Dr. Cousins. We also received an outline of the future on this project which gave us a clear roadmap for our work moving forward.  The work on the roadmap thus far is split into a series of three additional "modules". In this sprint, we received documentation for completing Module 1, this gives us the tools to hit the ground running next sprint. 

## Unfinished Work
The planning phase for Sprint 1 was finished with a very vague impression of our deliverables this sprint, due to the lack of an introductory meeting early on, as mentioned above. As a result, we aren't carrying over any work we comitted to in the next sprint, but we do have plans to add many things onto Sprint 2's plate that could have been brought into Sprint 1 had we had more time.
