# Sprint x Report (10/05/23 - 11/05/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Replaced CO2 Calibration buttons
 * Added %CO2 and uBar2 value displays
 * Altered raw data plot for specific masses

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The work completed this sprint involved various UI changes. Having relatibely little impact without functionality attached, we would have liked to see more progress on the backend of this project this sprint. While we've implemented the required UI elements, the corresponding features are not functional. Functionality will be added to these new UI elements in the next sprint. 

## Unfinished Work
Most of module 1 (Gamme module) has still not been completed.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/wsub-pythondesktopapp/issues/15 <<Not clarifying requirements in the beginning of the sprint made it difficult to assess exactly what needed to be accomplished.>>
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/wsub-pythondesktopapp/issues/17 <<It was expected that the realtime graph that already exists in the application would be more portable and able to be easily duplicated. This ended up not being the case and it will require much more work to support multiple real time graphs in our application.>>
